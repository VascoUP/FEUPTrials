WAKE UP!!!!
That's more like it...
Hello, how are you today?
Great!
Just letting you know that
YOU ARE ONE HOUR LATE!
Or don't you remember you have classes to attend to?
God, even your consciousness sounds like your mom.
Good thing is your dad left the bike home
You know what to do
:)
Now hurry up. The clock's ticking.
